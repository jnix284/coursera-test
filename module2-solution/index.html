<h1>Our Menu</h1>
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
      	<h2 id=sectiontitle1>Chicken</h2>
      	<p id=p1>This is where the text goes for the first column, this is the chicken dish on the menu and is probably the one that tastes the best.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
      	<h2 id=sectiontitle2>Beef</h2>
      	<p id=p2>This is where the text goes for the second column, this is the beef dish on the menu and is probably pretty good, too.</p></div>
      <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
      	<h2 id=sectiontitle3>Sushi</h2>
      	<p id=p3>This is where the text goes for the third column, this is the sushi dish on the menu and if that's your thing, you'll probably like it (I'm not really into sushi because I don't like seafood).</p>
